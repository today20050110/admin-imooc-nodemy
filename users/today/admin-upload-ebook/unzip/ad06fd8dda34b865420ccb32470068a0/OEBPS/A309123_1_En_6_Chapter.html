Several studies have attempted to quantify the uncertainties due to insufficient knowledge of the wave climate (e.g. Bitner-Gregersen and Guedes Soares <cite><a href="#CR8">2007</a></cite>) resulting in differences in long-term ship responses of up to 150 % of a nominal value, e.g. Guedes Soares and Trovao (<cite><a href="#CR18">1991</a></cite>), Bitner-Gregersen et al. (<cite><a href="#CR5">1995a</a></cite>). This high uncertainty may lead to overdesign/underdesign of ships, with consequent significant economic/risk impact.</div><div class="Para">Visual observations of waves collected from ships in normal service are currently used in the design of ship structures. Hogben and Lumb (<cite><a href="#CR19">1967</a></cite>) data were originally applied, but these were later replaced by the more reliable Global Wave Statistics (GWS) visual observations (British Maritime Technology, BMT <cite><a href="#CR11">1986</a></cite>). In the GWS atlas the ocean is divided into 104 regions as shown in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">6.1</a></span>. The visual data represent a sufficiently long observation history to provide reliable global climatic statistics. Wind speeds (Beaufort Scale) and directions, and wave heights in a coarse code have been reported since 1854. Observations of wave height, period, and direction have been collected from ships in normal service all over the world since 1949, and are made in accordance with guidance notes from the World Meteorological Organisation (<cite><a href="#CR37">2001</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR38">2003</a></cite>).<div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img src="A309123_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.gif" alt="A309123_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.gif"/></div><div class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 6.1</span><div class="SimplePara">Global wave statistics zone designation, BMT (<cite><a href="#CR11">1986</a></cite>)</div></div></div></div>
            </div><div class="Para">The utility of visual observations depends on appropriate calibration versus accurate measurements of the wave characteristics. BMT (<cite><a href="#CR11">1986</a></cite>) compared the GWS marginal distributions for wave heights and wave periods with instrumental Shipborne Wave Recorder and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoy data for different locations and concluded that the wave heights and periods for which statistics were given corresponded to measured values. However, the accuracy of the GWS data has been questioned, especially concerning the wave period (e.g., Bitner-Gregersen and Cramer <cite><a href="#CR40">1994</a></cite>; Bitner-Gregersen et al. <cite><a href="#CR5">1995a</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR6">b</a></cite>).</div><div class="Para">Several studies have addressed uncertainties in the Global Wave Statistics data and their effects on ship loads and responses, as well as on fatigue damage (Chen and Thayamballi <cite><a href="#CR12">1991</a></cite>; Bitner-Gregersen et al. <cite><a href="#CR39">1993</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#CR5">1995a</a></cite>), and have concluded that the GWS should be used with care. In 1995, a general procedure for correction of the mean wave period identified bias of the GWS data was suggested by Bitner-Gregersen et al. (<cite><a href="#CR6">1995b</a></cite>), and a scatter diagram for the North Atlantic, representing an average diagram for ocean zones 8, 9, and 15, was proposed for ship design. The scatter diagram was numerically generated from a joint distribution of wave height and wave period fitted to the GWS data, where the wave period distribution was corrected by the period bias. The original GWS data were not used. This was not only because of the wave period inaccuracy, but also, as in the GWS atlas, the last wave height class is in the range 11–12 m, indicating that observations of wave height beyond 12 m were summed up by BMT (<cite><a href="#CR11">1986</a></cite>) in this class. The numerically simulated North Atlantic scatter diagram altered the last wave height class to a height class range 16–17 m.</div><div class="Para">This adjusted scatter diagram has been adopted as a DNV standard in 2000 (today DNV RP-C205 <cite><a href="#CR15">2010</a></cite>). Later, on a request from the International Association of the Classification Societies (IACS), the North Atlantic scatter diagram was extended by DNV to include additionally the ocean area 16 (see Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">6.1</a></span>), using the procedure described above. The extended scatter diagram is included in IACS Recommendations No. 34 (<cite><a href="#CR22">2000</a></cite>), as well as in the DNV Recommended Practice (<cite><a href="#CR15">2010</a></cite>), and is regarded as a 20-year return period scatter diagram for ship design. It should be noted that this updated scatter diagram is slightly more conservative than the exact 20-year scatter diagram would be. For ship load and response calculations, a joint distribution of significant wave height and zero-crossing wave period is usually fitted to the data given by the scatter diagram, and the 20-year (or 25-year) return period is then derived from the fitted model. The DNV (<cite><a href="#CR15">2010</a></cite>) Recommended Practice is used for both ship and offshore structures. Note that the North Atlantic scatter diagram is also used for design of Floating Production Storage and Offloading systems (FPSOs), while other offshore structures are designed for location-specific met-ocean environments.</div><div class="Para">The necessity of replacing the current wave database for ship design by measured data, or by a combination of numerical and measured data, has increasingly become a subject for discussion within DNV and IACS in recent years. Currently, two other sources of global met-ocean climate are available, in addition to the ship observations. These are data from numerical wave prediction models and satellite data. Based on these data and on instrumental observations, several global databases have been developed. However, predictions based on these databases show significant discrepancies (see Bitner-Gregersen and Guedes Soares <cite><a href="#CR8">2007</a></cite>), and therefore they are presently unsuitable for establishing new design wave data statistics for ships. This topic needs to be revisited continuously as wave databases are under development.</div></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">6.2 </span>Hull Girder Collapse in Extreme Sagging Conditions</h2><div class="Para">In light of the findings summed up in <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A309123_1_En_4_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">Chap.​ 4</span></a></span> the next sections will illustrate the potential impacts that climate change may have on the design by using tanker design as an example.

The load analysis is carried out prior to the structural reliability analysis, with transfer functions stored on an interface file. This enable short- and long-term response calculation within the probabilistic analysis. The capacity calculation is an integrated part of the probabilistic analysis. In addition to the probability of failure, the SRA provides uncertainty importance factors, sensitivity factors and the design point which represents the most likely values of the variables at failure (see <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A309123_1_En_5_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">Sect.​ 5.​2</span></a></span>).

Results in terms of transfer functions (or Response Amplitude Operators, RAOs) for the midship vertical bending moment are used. The short- and long-term response is computed within the probabilistic analysis. The basic assumption is a narrow banded Gaussian response in each sea state. This assumption implies Rayleigh distributed maxima for a given sea state, for which a Gumbel type extreme value distribution can be derived. Finally, the annual extreme value distribution is obtained assuming independence between sea states. The approach using transfer functions with PROBAN is documented by Mathisen and Birknes (<cite><a href="#CR29">2003</a></cite>). This model captures the uncertainty in the short term response.</div><div class="Para">The annual probability of failure is calculated taking into account the relevant fraction of the year for which the ship is in the fully loaded condition and at sea; assumed to be 42.5 % of the year.</div><div class="Para">In heavy weather at sea, the ship is most likely to operate in head seas, or nearly head seas. The waves tend to be more long-crested in extreme sea states than in lower sea states. With these considerations, the analyses are carried out with the assumption of wave spreading corresponding to a cos<sup>4</sup> directional spreading function, and a triangular distribution of main heading with limits ±30  around head sea.</div><div class="Para">The Pierson Moskowitz (PM) wave spectrum is applied in the analyses. Furthermore, an assumption of zero-speed is adopted. This assumption is satisfactory, because in an ULS condition the forward speed is very low (less than 5 knots), and the load analysis is not sensitive to small forward speed variations as shown e.g. by Bitner-Gregersen et al. (<cite><a href="#CR7">2002</a></cite>).</div><div class="Para">A model uncertainty for the response calculation is applied in terms of a normally distributed uncertainty factor with a mean value of 1.0 and a coefficient of variation of 0.1. This uncertainty factor is assumed to cover uncertainty in the linear results, including the effect of uncertainty in the wave spectrum.

It is difficult to conclude on a “correct” model uncertainty to account for non-linear effects; e.g. the extent of green water on deck will tend to reduce the sagging moment.

The results are more useful on a comparative basis, and the absolute values should be interpreted with caution. In this context it should be noticed that the results presented here are for “net scantlings’’, which is part of the explanation of, what some would say, relatively high failure probabilities. Gross scantling, which is the net scantling plus the corrosion addition, would reduce the failure probabilities by approximately an order of magnitude. There may also be other reasons that the frequencies of hull girder failure in real life is lower than the calculated values reported here; e.g. weather routing is not accounted for, few ships operate in the North Atlantic throughout the lifetime, the yield strength is in many cases higher than the specification require.
