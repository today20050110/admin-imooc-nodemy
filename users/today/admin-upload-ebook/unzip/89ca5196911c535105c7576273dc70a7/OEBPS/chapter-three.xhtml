      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width"><span class="first-letter first-letter-i">I</span> don’t like the way she looks at me. It makes me feel like her next meal, and I don’t know what to do. Her fiery gaze boils my fear to the surface, and I know I have to move now. I glance at the two eggs underneath her then at the golden egg. My legs start to shake. I badly want to place the egg back where it belongs, but I don’t want to step any closer to this mother dragon. She has the look of protection in her eyes as though she is about to swoop down and kill me.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Holding the egg firmly in my outstretched arms, I attempt to edge forward, hoping she understands that I want to return the egg, but my feet won’t move. They are frozen in place, with the quivering turning my legs to jelly.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Dropping to my knees, I lower my gaze, slowly pushing the egg farther toward her while stretching my arms as far as they will go. Then, ever so slowly, I let my eyes creep up to look at the mother. I don’t know if the mother will see this as a submissive gesture or not. I am definitely offering her egg back to her.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Please, take it back.” It takes all of my strength to keep my voice calm and even. “I was only trying to protect the egg. The only reason your egg is in my hands is because I was stopping the creature from stealing it, then I had to save it from rolling off the cliff. I’m not trying to take your egg.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I have no idea if this wild dragon can understand me, but at this stage, anything is worth a try. The dragon flings her head back and snorts out a large plume of smoke. For a second, the air in front of me is cloudy with its haze. Eventually, the smoke clears, revealing her piercing golden-brown eyes first.</p>
      <p class="subsq">If she understands me, I don’t know if she believes me. It doesn’t matter. I have no choice. I’m about to lower the egg to the ground and see if I can turn and run, trying out my chances of escaping in one piece. Even so, the niggling voice deep down is still screaming that I am a fool to think I can get away. But I must try.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The egg starts to inch toward me when I feel the ground rumble beneath me after a thump. The dragon has landed not far from me. She towers over me and gazes down. I don’t know if I’m about to lose my head, and now my arms are starting to shake as well.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I-I promise. I-I was only protecting your egg,” I stutter, trying to stop my arms from shaking so much before I drop the egg. Slowly, I lower my arms and place the egg on the ground in front of the dragon, tilting my head respectfully. “Please, don’t kill me.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Answered by silence, I start to back away, only to be startled when a voice booms through my head.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i>You should not be here, Valkyrie.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">I look around for the person who was talking to me, but no one is in sight. It is a strange feeling. I am certain that it was in my head, but I have never had this experience before–my ears are deaf to the sound, and it echoes through the corners of my brain.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i>It is no use looking around, Valkyrie. It is I who speaks to you.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">I look up, and my eyes meet hers, which are gold and piercing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The dragon nods in acknowledgement. <i>Yes, I am the one who is speaking to you.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">A strange combination of emotions is running through those eyes. They are not quite as piercing as I first thought, but I am still uncomfortable in their presence.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i>Normally, I would kill you for being near my eggs. But I saw what you did. And I will spare you this time.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Something makes a cracking noise, and I look down. The egg has a large split down the middle. I gasp. &quot;Oh Vanir! Did it get broken?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">The dragon shuffles forward and stands over the egg.<i> The shell was damaged, yes, but the hatchling is about to come. Now go. Never before have I been indebted to a Valkyrie or any other being, and I do not like it. So go, before I change my mind.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">I don't need reminding—I nod and back away. The second I feel I am far enough away, I turn my back and run.</p>
