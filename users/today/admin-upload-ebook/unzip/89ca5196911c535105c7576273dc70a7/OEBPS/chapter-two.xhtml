      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width"><span class="first-letter first-letter-i">I</span> dart behind the nearest boulder then squat and peek around the side. The winged creature isn’t quite as big as I am but enough to be frightening. Bat-like membranous wings the color of dirty cream protrude from a round dark-furred body and flap steadily. It flaps and hovers an inch above something on the ground. I gaze down, and I’m shocked to see what is beneath. In a small little circle underneath the creature’s claws lie three golden dragon eggs glistening in the sun.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Though I didn’t realize I had traveled so far, somehow, I have reached the wildlands of the dragons–dangerous territory. I shouldn’t be out here. Any dragons out here are wild, untamed, and free to attack at any moment. The dragons that we have within the confines of the academy’s walls are secured with chains–often used as slaves for the winged Valkyries to practice their fighting with. Even so, the wild dragons are revered, especially the golden one, which is the fiercest of them all.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I quickly search the area, and I can’t see any sign of dragons. These mesmerizing eggs must belong to one of the emperor dragons, which are the elite dragon species and highly dangerous and never tamed or kept at the academy, as they are too wild and strong-minded to control, and they are ranked at the top of the hierarchy of dragons. Their size is alarming, and their beauty great, not to mention their natural weapons. Large claws extend from their paws, matched by long horns and spikes on the edges of their wings. All are designed to inflict an enormous amount of damage, and the plumes of fire they breathe are more powerful than any other dragon’s.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This winged creature’s beady eyes dart rapidly across the wilderness, seemly searching the area. It dives to the ground and clasps its claws around one of the eggs. I freeze in terror as I realize that it is about to take one of the eggs. I have great respect for these golden dragons, and they are a rare breed—I don’t want to see them become extinct.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I am uncertain what this creature’s intentions are. Maybe it is hungry, or maybe it is grabbing it for another reason. I have heard that there is a black market for dragon eggs. It is believed that, if eaten, the eggs will give the warriors greater strength to use in battle. Other rumors say that the dragons can be raised as soldiers for a secret army. With this particular breed, I wish people luck in trying to tame them. Whatever the reason this creature has to be stealing the egg, I am not going to let it happen on my watch.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Searching the rugged terrain for the perfect-sized rock, I grope around my waist for my sling. My shaking fingers find the rough material woven from durable fibers, and I unhook it from the back of my pants. I spot a rock within reach, scoop it up, and slide it into my sling. While I take a deep breath, I twirl it around my head a couple of times, and I let it fly, aiming straight for the creature. The rock slams into the side of its body, and a crack faintly reaches my ears. The creature cries out, showing off the many teeth lining the inside of its long jaw. I scramble for another rock and sling it toward the creature, trying to hit it in a more significant place, but the rock misses, narrowly skimming the creature’s fur as it flies past, and I curse my lack of experience. It is only my first year at Valkyrie Academy, and I have not yet perfected my swing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">My body tenses, and my heart skips a beat as the creature looks up, searching for where the rocks have come from. Its beady eyes land on me then narrow. My neck stiffens in fear. I am certain that it is about to come after me. Instead, the creature drops down again, gropes for the egg, and grasps it in its claws before flapping its enormous wings and taking to the sky.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I scan the ground again, hoping to find more rocks, and exhale loudly with excitement when I spot some more. I slide them one by one into my sling and hit the creature. It squawks loudly when one hits it on the wing, and the second one collides with its leg. As it connects, a sickening crack, much louder than before, reaches my ears. The creature cries out again, and I silently congratulate myself that the hours of practice have paid off.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The creature drops the egg, and I clench my teeth as I watch it fall to the hard ground. It is only a short distance, but I hope that it isn’t so far that the egg would crack open before the baby is ready to come.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I run at the creature, scooping up more rocks while watching as it flaps its enormous wings. The creature’s eyes narrow, and it aims directly for me, even though the rocks I am slinging are hitting the target. Even the struggle with its injured wing doesn’t stop it from coming toward me and swooping down. I duck away from its grasp, yet the long claws wrap around my upper arm and over my shoulder and clasp me firmly. My feet lift off the ground as we ascend.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Pulling my strength from my torso, I swing my feet up and kick the creature in its belly right where I hit it with the rock the first time. It cries out and drops me but not without scraping its claws farther along my arm and drawing blood. After I land hard on my side, an intense pain shoots to my hip. I refuse to let this deter me, and I search the ground for more rocks and fire them at the creature.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It turns and takes to the sky, causing my heart to soar as it leaves me on the ground.</p>
      <p class="subsq">When I am confident that it will not return, I clip my sling on the back of my pants and glance over at the three eggs. My breath catches in my throat when I see one is slowly rolling down the hill toward a cliff. I break into a run, hoping that I will be fast enough to get to the egg before it tumbles over the side. Its momentum increases, and it rolls faster. I dig my toes into the hard ground and sprint.</p>
      <p class="subsq">With only seconds until it reaches the edge, I dive, reaching as far as I can, trying to block the egg’s path before it falls. I land hard on the solid ground and grunt in pain as I scrape my arm all the way up the side, and a jagged rock jabs into my ribs. That will definitely cause a bruise.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I wrap my arms around the egg and hug it close. It is surprising how warm it is. Dragons’ eggs are usually warm, but this burns from the rays of the sun, which give it the much-needed heat when the mother is away. I hold it close, drawing comfort from the heat. As much as I hate the duty of cleaning out the dragon pens at the academy, I am always mesmerized by the creatures and enjoy the time that I spend with them. It is during this time that I can study them and their different breeds.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As I hold the egg, I stare down at the beautiful gold color and wonder what it would be like to study this dragon up close and take in the different features from a real perspective rather than a book.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I stroke the egg softly and whisper, “It’s okay, little baby. I got you. May you grow into a big, strong dragon. I don’t know where your mommy is or why she isn’t here to protect you. But don’t worry. I’ll protect you.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I stroke the egg some more, and a tingling feeling shoots up my arm. When I wriggle my fingers, I realize my arm is bleeding. It must be from the injury caused by the creature, and I hope it isn’t infected. I stroke the egg one more time, marveling at the golden glint under the sun. “I shall take you back to your nest with the eggs of your siblings, then I must go.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Holding it tight, I walk in the direction of the nest. I glance up to watch where I’m going and stop short. Before me, standing over her remaining eggs, is a large golden dragon–the emperor dragon–and I can tell by the fiery glint in her eyes that she is the mother.</p>
